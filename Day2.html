que1:  What is the Difference between react and react native? Which one is library or framework?
---------->
Reactjs--------------------->

1]Best for Interactive UI & UX development
2]Reusable Components
3]Re-Useable Codes
4]Simple UI even for New Users
5]Primarily for Web Development
6]Basically A Library


React native----------------->

1]Best for Mobile App Development & Cross-Platform App
2]Pre-Built Components for Convenience in Development
3]Fast-Rendering
4]Easier Development for Cross-Platform Work
5]Primarily for Mobile & Cross-Platform App
6]Basically A Framework

Reactjs is a library of JavaScript and react native is a framework.

que2:What is the package name you are using for routing

ans: react-router-dom is the package name of routing.
React Router is a standard library system built on top of the React and used to create routing in the React application using React Router Package.
In this Browser Router as Router, Routes and Route and NavLink get imported from react-router-dom.
 React Router DOM enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. 
 Unlike the traditional routing architecture in which the routing is handled in a configuration outside of a running app, React Router DOM facilitates component-based routing according to the needs of the app and platform.

que4: What is lazy loading in react ? 

ans:
1]In essence, lazy loading means that a component or a part of code must get loaded when it is required. It is also referred to as code splitting and data fetching . Talking about React specifically, it bundles the complete code and deploys all of it at the same time.

2]Lazy loading is the practice of delaying load or initialization of resources or objects until they’re actually needed to improve performance and save system resources. 

For example, if a web page has an image that the user has to scroll down to see, you can display a placeholder and lazy load the full image only when the user arrives to its location.

The benefits of lazy loading include:

Reduces initial load time – 
Lazy loading a webpage reduces page weight, allowing for a quicker page load time.

Bandwidth conservation – 
Lazy loading conserves bandwidth by delivering content to users only if it’s requested.

System resource conservation – 
Lazy loading conserves both server and client resources, because only some of the images, JavaScript and other code actually needs to be rendered or executed.

Syntax----------->
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));

que5:Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component

ans: Stateful Component:----------------->
If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor.

render() {
    // ...
  }
}
-------------------*----------------------------
stateless Component------------>

If the behaviour of a component is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether.
const App = (props) => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
    return (
      // JSX
    )
  }

que6:How do you switch one component to another, Conditional Rendering

ans: Way to Switch/Navigate from one page to another page
Link
NavLink
Redirect Component
history.push
history.replace
Link Link is used to manage the navigation and it worked as an anchor tag. Check below code for the demonstration. import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'; ... ...
About
NavLink NavLink behaves the same as Link but in addition, it comes with a new attribute called “activeClassName” which helps us to add the class to the anchor tag when page url will match.

import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'; ... ... About
